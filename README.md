# Restaurant Insights Dashboard Project ðŸš€

This Power BI project provides an in-depth analysis of restaurant data from across various countries and cities. The dashboard is designed to showcase key insights into restaurant performance, user ratings, cuisine preferences, and geographic trends. 

### Key Features:
- **Geographical Analysis**: Visualize restaurant density and performance across cities and localities.  
- **Cuisine Insights**: Explore popular cuisines and their availability in different regions.  
- **User Ratings & Trends**: Analyze ratings to identify top-rated restaurants and trends over time.  
- **Cost Analysis**: Compare dining costs across locations and currencies.  

### Why This Project?  
This project demonstrates proficiency in Power BI by solving real-world business problems with data visualization. It is ideal for showcasing skills in building interactive and data-driven dashboards.

### Tools Used:
- Power BI for data modeling and visualization  
- Excel for data preparation  

The dataset consists of two sheets:

### Sheet 1:
This sheet provides detailed information about restaurants, including:
- Restaurant ID
- Country code
- City and locality
- Coordinates (longitude and latitude)
- Cuisines offered
